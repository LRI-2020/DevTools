    <h2>You can always count on me when ... </h2>
    <p>Always ready to try to help when needed, either for a technical problem or if you feel like having a chat!
        Cannot promise I will succeed to find the answer to your problem but I promise I will try to help you as much as
        I can!</p>

    <h2>A funny story</h2>
    <p>Well I am a really clumsy person. Some years ago, I managed to let a knife fell on the foot of my husband (by
        accident, I swear ðŸ˜¬) That was hopefully not a so serious injury but still, we had to go to the emergency. The
        doctor and nurses were really laughing at us. We are still married today so I suppose he is not too much
        resentful about that...</p>
    <h3>TL;DR</h3>
    <p>Just don't let me go near a knife ...</p>
